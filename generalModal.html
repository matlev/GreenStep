	A reduction target is the amount of emissions your organization commits to reduct. Establishing an emission reduction targets can help your company on its path to low-carbon business. To set your reduction target, you will need to specify:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Base Year</b> - the reference year against which performance is measured over time. Select a base year for which reliable data are available. For many, this could be the first year you conduct a GHG inventory.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Reduction Target</b> - the reduction goal. expressed as a percentage reduction in emissios below those estimated for the base year. For example, you might choose to reduce emissions by 10% over the base year.
		</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Target Year</b> - the year that the reduction target will be achieved.

	<h4>Emission Sources Setup</h4>
	<div style="border-top: solid 10px #5CB357"> </div>
	<br>
	
	Now that you have set up the organizational boundary for your GHG Inventory, you need to consider all the ways your operations genrate emissions and decide which of these you will track for each business unit. Making these selections is called defining the "operational boundary" for your greenhouse gas inventory.
	<br>

	To determine which emission sources to track, you need to first understand how emissions are categorized. As defined by The Greenhouse Gas Protool, greenhouse gases from a business are categorized into three "scopes". Scope 1 includes direct emissions from sources that hte business owns or controls. Scopes 2 and 3 include indirect emissions, which are also from business activities but occur from sources owned or controlled by another organization. Emissions are defined as direct and indict to help clarify which emissions are organization owns or controls (direct) and which are not (indirect).

	<br>
	
	Select the emission scope you wish to configure.
	<br><br>
	<b>Scope 1 emissions</b> - direct emissions from sources that the business owns or controls, such as emissions from boilers, furnaces or company cars. If your company leases equipement or vehicles and pays for the fuel used, these emissions are also counted as Scope 1. Accounting for Scope 1 emissions is required under the GHG Protocol.
	<br><br>
	<b>Scope 2 emissions</b> - indirect emissions from the use of purchased electricity, steam, heat or cooling. While these emissions result from your business activities, they occur from sources owned or controlled by another organization, such as an electric utility or a district heating company. Accounting for Scope 2 emissions is required under the GHG Protocol because these are likely to make up a significant share of an organization's inventory and are easy to track.
	<br><br>
	<b>Scope 3 emissions</b> - all other indirect emissions, such as business travel in non-company-owned vehicles, employee commuting, paper usage, waste disposal and recyling. Accounting for Scope 3 emissions is not mandatory in the GHG Protocol but is encouraged because it increases opportunities for emissions reductions.
